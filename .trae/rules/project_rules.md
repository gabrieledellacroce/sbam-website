## Site Structure Rules
- The site MUST use folder-based structure with index.html files instead of .html files
- Main website: main-site/index.html (NOT main-site.html)
- Dashboard: dashboard/index.html (NOT dashboard.html)
- Root index.html remains the password protection page
- All internal links must use clean URLs (e.g., /main-site/, /dashboard/)
- Image and CSS paths must be relative to the folder structure (e.g., ../images/, ../style.css)
